# WordSync: Crossword Wordlist Manager

Update crossword wordlists from anywhere and sync using GitHub! Browse, sort, search, and filter your list as well as add, rescore, and delete entries. Wordlist modifications can be pushed to a remote repository or saved locally.

To use a GitHub-hosted wordlist, you'll need a fine-grained [personal access token](https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens) with both **read** and **write** access to code. Repository information and tokens are stored locally and are not accessible by anyone else.
