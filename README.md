# WordSync: Crossword Wordlist Manager

Update crossword wordlists from anywhere and sync using GitHub! Browse, sort, search, and filter your list as well as add, rescore, and delete entries. Wordlist modifications can be pushed to a remote repository or saved locally. A great free starter wordlist can be found [here](https://www.spreadthewordlist.com/). 

This is a simple web app made with raw HTML/CSS/JS and a simple JS backend for authenticating with GitHub.
